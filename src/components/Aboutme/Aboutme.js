                    Born and raised in Montreal Canada, I have always been drawn to things that operate with flawless functionality.
                    I spent more than a decade in the aviation industry until I learned of the coding world. From then on I had a thirst for knowledge, in any language or
                    library, I wanted to be efficient. I am versed in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Jquery, React, Handlebars, NodeJS, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, and more.
                    I hope you enjoy this showcase of my work here.
